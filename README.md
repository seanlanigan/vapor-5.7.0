# vaport-5.7.0
Attempt to create a buildpack to allow me to build a Swift 5.7.0 application on Heroku.

2022/06/30

Found that the application that I wanted to run
on Heroku will run under Swift 2.6.2, so I do
not need to modify vapor/vapor to 3.7.0.

I will probably keep this, and use it to debug
any vapor/vapor 4.x.x issues.
